# Bunny Mark

The purpose of this tool is to crudely sanity-check relative performance changes in PixiJS between
release versions and branches. It is not designed to show off the performance capabilities of PixiJS and does not reflect typical, real-world rendering conditions. Different devices will have different performance thresholds.
